# BlackPearl-cgproject
## Introduction:
"Black Pearl - The Cursed Ship" is a dynamic computer graphics project inspired by the iconic ship from the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl." Developed using C/C++ and the OpenGL API, this project brings to life the famed ship in a continuous day-to-night cycle. It serves as a mini-project crafted by computer science students to demonstrate their skills in computer graphics, animation, and interactive programming.
## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to simulate the sailing of the Black Pearl through different times of the day, transitioning smoothly from morning to late night. The simulation includes realistic lighting changes, reflecting the natural light conditions associated with different times. Players interact with the simulation using various keyboard functions, controlling aspects of the ship's movement and the environment's dynamic features.

## Technology Used:
This project utilizes C/C++ programming languages for core development, leveraging the extensive capabilities of the OpenGL API for rendering graphics. The use of the GLUT library simplifies window management and input handling, allowing for enhanced interaction through keyboard inputs. The project incorporates advanced computer graphics techniques including lighting, texturing, and transformations to authentically portray the day-night cycle and the ship’s detailed features.

## Goal:
The goal of "Black Pearl - The Cursed Ship" is twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users, allowing them to control and witness the majestic sailing of the cursed ship across varied lighting and weather scenarios. Secondly, the project is an educational tool, showcasing the students' proficiency in creating complex animations and graphics using OpenGL. It demonstrates their understanding of graphic rendering processes, user input handling, and real-time animation techniques. This project not only reflects the technical knowledge and programming prowess of the students but also their creativity in replicating a culturally iconic vessel in a digital format.
